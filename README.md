# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of school district analysis

The purpose of the schoole district analysis is to review math and reading grades from Thomas High School because their is evidence of acadmeic dishonesty in the ninth grade class. I was tasked with replacing the suspect grades with "NaNs" while keeping all other data unaltered. After completing this task I was asked to provide an explanation of how the changes impacted the data.

## Results

- How is the district summary affected?
This set of data was largely unchanged because the data removed was a small subset.

- How is the school summary affected?
Only Thomas High data impacted.

- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
--Overall passing rate down slightly.

- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- Math and reading scores by grade
--Ninth grade data slightly down

- Scores by school spending
--Data largely unaffected.

- Scores by school size
--Data largely unaffected.

- Scores by school type
--Charter school slightly down.

## Summary
Four major changes in data

1. Number of students counted in Thomas decreased
2. Total number of students down
3. Overall percenteages for math and reading
4. Average math and reading scores

Changing the 9th grade data for Thomas High School did not cause much of change to the overall data and Thomas High despite the allegations of cheating.
